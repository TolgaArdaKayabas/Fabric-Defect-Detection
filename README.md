# Fabric Defect Detection using Deep Learning 🧠

This project aims to automatically detect fabric defects such as holes, stains, and weaving irregularities using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
It applies **image preprocessing, resizing, and model training** techniques to classify fabric images as “defective” or “non-defective.”

## 🧩 Features
- Image preprocessing and resizing pipeline (`Resize.py`)
- CNN model training and evaluation (`Train and Test.py`)
- Real-time prediction and visualization (`main.py`)
- Pre-trained model weights included (`densenet_single_class_model.h5`)
- Custom dataset integrated for textile quality inspection

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**

## 📊 Model Performance
The trained CNN model achieved **92% accuracy** on the test dataset, demonstrating strong potential for real-world textile defect detection and quality control systems.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Multi-class defect classification (e.g., hole, stain, misweave)
- Integration with real-time camera systems
- Deployment as a web-based inspection tool
